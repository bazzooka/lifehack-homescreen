# POC on dribbble animation

## Description

Try to develop a funny dribbble : https://dribbble.com/shots/2264986-Lifehack-homescrren

You can see the result on : http://bazzooka.github.io/lifehack-homescreen/

Love it so I decided to try it.
Funny parts are : 
 - SVG draw without graphic editor (nice to implements it)
 - SVG mask on heart button
 - DOM animation when you like a post. All the great job goes to : https://gist.github.com/fta2012/bd63f7fd9f385870efc0

## Caveats
Not very fluid on mobile :(

## Installation
Install the dependencies with : 
> npm install

Compile ES6 sources with
> npm browserify

## Todo
